# BookBot

**BookBot** is a Python command-line program that analyzes the contents of books. It counts the total number of words, calculates the frequency of each character (ignoring case), and prints a sorted report of the most common alphabetical characters.

## Motivation

The goal of BookBot is to provide a simple, transparent way to analyze text data using plain Python. No external dependencies required. This project also serves as an introduction to:

- File I/O in Python
- Command-line interface design
- Basic text analysis
- Clean code and project structure
